                <h3>What exactly is a pound cake?</h3>
                <p>The first traces of pound cake recipes are in northern Europe in the 1700s and it has grown across the globe since. A cake that required equal parts of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs was easy to remember in a time where many could not
                    read a traditional cookbook. It required nothing more than a spoon and some elbow grease in the kitchen. Hundreds of years later, nearly every region is making its own version of this moist, dense cake. </p><br><br>
                <p> <img src="./images/cream-cheese-pound-cake-2.jpg " width="80%" alt=" " /><br> In some French-speaking countries, rum is added as a Christmas Eve tradition. In both Mexico and Germany, dried fruit and liquor are added. I have some other
                    variation ideas below, and they’re all phenomenal! Cream cheese pound cake is an American twist on the classic, and it is downright delicious.
                    <br><br> Many modern recipes, including this one, adjust the original one pound-only proportions to accommodate some other ingredients (like cream cheese!).</p>

                <h3>Ingredients for cream cheese pound cake</h3>
                <ul class="menu-4 ">
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Butter</strong> – The building block for every buttery, delicious pound cake. Since so much of the flavor comes through, I always recommend using a high-quality butter here; I love Kerrygold.</li>
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Cheese</strong> – This helps create a stunningly moist pound cake. Use full-fat cream cheese here; it has less water content than low-fat alternatives, which ensures a cake that will never be dry.</li>
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Eggs</strong> – They hold everything together! Make sure they are at room temperature, too.</li>
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Cake Flour</strong> – Cake flour has less protein than all-purpose flour, which makes for a lighter crumb. I do not recommend substituting all-purpose flour, as the cake will be heavy and dense. </li>
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Sugar</strong> -Regular, granulated sugar is what we’re using.</li>
                    <li><strong class="make-1 ">Vanilla Extract & Salt</strong> – For incredible flavor!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to make cream cheese pound cake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Generously grease (I think shortening works best!) and flour a standard 12-cup Bundt pan. Be sure that the pan holds 10 to 12 cups of batter.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Beat the butter and cream cheese together until they are completely combined and totally smooth. This will take a couple of minutes, just be sure the mixture is super smooth before proceeding.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Beat in the sugar until the entire mixture is light and fluffy. You really want to aerate the mixture and ensure it’s light as a cloud before adding the eggs; this can take about 5 minutes or so.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Add eggs one at a time, scraping the sides between each egg. Since they are room temperature, they should incorporate quickly, which helps us not to overmix the batter!</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Gradually add the cake flour on low speed until almost completely incorporated, then add the vanilla and salt. We mix only until everything has combined, no longer.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Spoon into the prepared pan and gently spread into an even layer.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Bake for 75 to 90 minutes at 325 degrees, or until a knife or toothpick comes out clean.</li>
                    <li class="menu-3 ">Cool, then turn out. Let the cake cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, and turn it out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ol>
