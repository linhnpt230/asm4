                <h2>Coconut Bundt Cake with White Chocolate-Coconut Glaze</h2>
                <p>Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for Sunday dinner. Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people, since we have help
                    polishing it all off and don’t have it sitting around the house, tempting us for days.<br>
                    <img src="./images/coconut-bundt-cake.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /><br><br> I love anything with coconut during the spring and summertime, and Bundt cakes are not only easy but they’re pretty and are perfect for serving a crowd. When
                    I started flipping through a couple of my newer cookbooks and saw a recipe for a coconut Bundt cake, dessert was immediately decided.<br><br> This cake comes pretty darn close to a coconut pound cake, as there is quite a bit of butter,
                    sugar and eggs that help to create a wonderfully rich and moist cake. The coconut flavor is derived from a large amount of coconut milk in both the cake and glaze, as well as a healthy dose of coconut extract. I also added toasted
                    shredded coconut on top of the glaze because, well, I feel like any type of coconut dessert needs to be topped with toasted coconut.<br><br> A couple of years ago, a coconut cake would have never ranked high on my list of cake options,
                    but between the coconut cupcakes I made last year and this cake, I am a total coconut convert.<br><br> Plus, after everyone went home yesterday, we were only left with two small pieces of cake. Win-win!<br><br>

                <h3>what is Coconut Bundt Cake </h3>
                <p>The Bundt cake derives in part from a European brioche-like cake called Gugelhupf. In the north of Germany Gugelhupf is traditionally known as Bundkuchen, a name formed by joining the two words Bund and Kuchen (cake)<br><br> Opinions differ
                    as to the significance of the word Bund. One possibility is that it means "bunch" or "bundle", and refers to the way the dough is bundled around the tubed center of the pan. In Dutch, the cake is called "tulband," which is Dutch for
                    'turban.' The pronunciation of the second part of this word is very similar to that of 'bundt.' Another source suggests that it describes the banded appearance given to the cake by the fluted sides of the pan, similar to a tied sheaf
                    or bundle of wheat.[2] Some authors have suggested that Bund instead refers to a group of people, and that Bundkuchen is so called because of its suitability for parties and gatherings<br><br> Gradually people began to improve to help
                    the cake not be boring, people added other ingredients to the cake to get the coconut bundt cake like today.

                <h3>Now,let's make coconut bundt cake with me</h3>
                <strong class="make-1">Ingredients to prepare</strong>
                <br>
                <u>For the Cake:</u>
                <ul class="menu-2">
                    <li>3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour</li><br>
                    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li><br>
                    <li>½ teaspoon (0.5 teaspoon) kosher salt</li><br>
                    <li>1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li><br>
                    <li>2½ cups (500 g) granulated sugar</li><br>
                    <li>2 eggs</li><br>
                    <li>2 egg yolks</li><br>
                    <li>2 tablespoons coconut extract</li><br>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li><br>
                    <li>1⅓ cups (320 ml) unsweetened coconut milk</li><br>
                </ul>

                <u>For the Glaze:</u><br>
                <ul class="menu-2">
                    <li>4 to 6 tablespoons coconut milk</li><br>
                    <li>½ teaspoon (0.5 teaspoon) coconut extract</li><br>
                    <li>½ teaspoon (0.5 teaspoon) vanilla extract</li><br>
                    <li>2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar, sifted</li><br>
                    <li>6 ounces (170.1 g) white chocolate, melted and still warm</li>
                </ul>
                <u>To garnish</u>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="menu-2"> Shredded coconut, toasted</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <strong class="make-1">Making</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li class="menu-3">Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 10-cup or 12-cup Bundt pan.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the eggs and the yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape
                        down the bowl again, add the coconut and vanilla extracts, and beat until just incorporated.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the coconut milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, mixing after each addition until just combined; do not overmix.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top into an even layer. Bake until a sharp knife or toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer the pan to a
                        wire rack to cool completely. Gently loosen the sides of the cake from the pan and turn it out onto the rack.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">Make the Glaze: In a large bowl, whisk together 4 tablespoons of the coconut milk, the coconut extract and vanilla extract. Add the powdered sugar and whisk until incorporated and smooth. Slowly stir in the white chocolate. The glaze
                        should be thick yet pourable; if the glaze appears too thick, thin it out with addition coconut milk, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.</li><br>
                    <li class="menu-3">Pour the glaze in large, thick ribbons over the crown of the cake, allowing the glaze to spread and drip down the sides of the cake. Top with the toasted shredded coconut immediately and allow the glaze to set before serving, about
                        5 minutes. The cake can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p><u>Note:</u>
                <p> I used canned coconut milk for this recipe (Goya brand found in the Hispanic section of the local grocery store) - one 13.5-ounce can was enough for the cake and frosting.</p><br></aside>
