            <h2>Yellow cake with chocolate frosting</h2>
            <p>This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from scratch and paired with the silky smooth chocolate frosting,you can't beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration!<br>
                <img src="./images/chocolate-cake-2.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /><br><br>Are you a box mix yellow cake person?Or a from cratch yellow cake person?
                <br><br> Truth be told,it REALLY hard to replicate that always-moist-and-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake mix,but at the same time,we also love homemade,right<br><br> It took me a LONG time to find a homemade yellow
                cake that I really,really loved.Box cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy and moist yellow cakes,and the ones I've had from bakeries have been great as well,but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no matter how many
                recipes I tried.(Consequently,I haven't had the same issue with chocolate cakes!See:Snickers Cake-the base recipe for all of my chocolate cakes!)<br><br> Many were too dense,too dry,too chiffon-like,too fussy in their preparation.I just
                wanted a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious.I came across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday.<br><br>                This was IT.The recipe that had eluded me for years!<br><br>
                <img src="./images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-2.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /><br><br> I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand mixer;there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or preparation,and it produces
                an absolutely perfect yellow cake.The layers are light but study,buttery and moist,and the ideal base for your very favourite chocolate frosting.<br><br> I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes,and it was
                a wonderful companion to this cake.The frosting is more buttery than sugary,satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor.It glides on like a dream!<br><br>
                <img src="./images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-3.jpg" width="80%" alt="" /><br><br> Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking;so many cakes can turn out too dry,too crumbly,too dense,too cornbread-like,and I have
                one major piece of advice for ensuring yellow cake perfection:<br>
                <strong>Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature"ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. </strong><br><br> I've totally been there and have used still-cool butter,eggs or dairy in a recipe when I'm in a hurry,but it's actually
                vitally important here.Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that they emulsify,which traps air in the batter and,once in the oven,that air expands and produces a fluffy cake.<br><br> Room temperature ingredients
                also ensure that the batter comes together well and is ultra-smooth,which keeps the resulting cake from being crumbly or cornbread-like.<br><br>
